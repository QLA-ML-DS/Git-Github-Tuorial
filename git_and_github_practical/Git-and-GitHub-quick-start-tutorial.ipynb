    "**Note:**  A centralized version control system has a single server that contains all the file versions. This enables multiple clients to simultaneously access files on the server, pull them to their local computer or push them onto the server from their local computer. This allows for easy collaboration with other developers or a team. The biggest issue with this structure is that everything is stored on the centralized server. If something were to happen to that server, nobody can save their versioned changes, pull files or collaborate at all. With distributed version control systems, clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files from the server, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, everyone collaborating on a project owns a local copy of the whole project, i.e. owns their own local database with their own complete history. With this model, if the server becomes unavailable or dies, any of the client repositories can send a copy of the project's version to any other client or back onto the server when it becomes available."

    "1. Create a repository by clicking `Add New Repo`. Do not initialize with a `README`at this point. We can call the repository `project`. Your repository has been created at `github.com/you/project`. It should be completely empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. On yout local machine (your computer), from the command line, create a new folder called `project-local`\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir project-local\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Move into the newly created directory\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "Now you're in the folder where your local project and Git repository will live. From here, we will begin using git commands.\n",
